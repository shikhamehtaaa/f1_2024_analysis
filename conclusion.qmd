# Conclusion

This project set out to evaluate what truly drives Formula 1 driver performance once external factors such as car strength, circuit characteristics, and weather variability are controlled for, and the analyses across qualifying pace, racecraft, wet-weather adaptability, circuit type differences, and overtaking difficulty reveal a fairly consistent story that driver performance within a team is overwhelmingly defined by qualifying pace, with racecraft providing the next strongest source of differentiation. Condition-specific factors, like wet races, street circuits, and overtaking difficulty, proved far less influential in determining intra-team outcomes, a finding reinforced by the interpretable logistic model and Shapley value analysis. The model’s strong alignment with actual 2024 intra-team standings shows that a small number of intuitive, interpretable features explain much of the competitive hierarchy among teammates. At the same time, the mismatches highlight critical limitations of purely performance-based modeling, like luck-driven events such as engine failures, long pit stops, safety-car timing, DNFs, and team strategy calls can meaningfully distort race outcomes in ways not captured by average pace or racecraft metrics. Future extensions could explore further explicitly modeling these randomness components, quantifying reliability effects, pit stop variance, or luckier strategy. Overall, this project demonstrates how contextualized data analysis and interpretable machine learning together can uncover the defining factors of driver performance, separating true skill from the noise introduced by machinery and environment.
