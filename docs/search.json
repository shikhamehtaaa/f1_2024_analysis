    "text": "3.1 Compare differences in positions gained within each constructor to determine racecraft abilities, indicating higher competenecies in overtaking and defending position.\nMy analysis of the 2024 Formula 1 season reveals clear and consistent patterns in how drivers perform relative to their teammates once we account for context such as track type, wet weather, and overtaking difficulty. First, I analyzed intra-team comparisons for popular driver rating features: pace (based on qualifying performance) and racecraft (based on positions overtaken). Afterwards, I incorporated track type, track conditioners, and circuit difficulty to gain a better understanding of intra-team dynamics and success. Finally, I ran a basic prediction to determine how accounting for these external factors’ impact on pace and racecraft contribute to driver success, and I compared the prediction to the actual 2024 season standings. Across the grid, the strongest predictor of success is intuitive in that drivers who qualify better tend to finish better, even after adjusting for conditions. Racecraft helps explain additional differences, especially on street circuits and in wet weather, where confidence and adaptability matter even more. Visualizing these patterns highlights which drivers consistently extract more performance from their car and which teams show the largest gaps between their two drivers. Overall, the results paint a nuanced picture of driver skill that goes beyond championship points, offering a more context-aware understanding of what made certain drivers successful in 2024.\n##How do teammates compare in qualifying pace? - Drivers within the same car often show meaningful performance gaps.\nDrivers within the same team use identical cars, so differences in their qualifying positions reveal how much performance comes from the driver rather than the machinery. Moreover, this is an extremely common metric for evaluating pace when rating drivers. Across the grid, several teams show clear internal gaps: for example, Verstappen at Red Bull and Leclerc at Ferrari consistently qualify several positions ahead of their teammates. Other teams, such as McLaren, show much tighter spreads, indicating more evenly matched driver pairings in terms of pace. Teams that rotated drivers mid-season display wider and noisier distributions because some drivers have fewer appearances.\n##Teammate Comparisons Reveal Which Drivers Consistently Extract More Pace From the Car\nAcross the season, average Q1–Q3 times highlight meaningful performance gaps within several teams. This visualization allows us an easier at a glance look at intra-team dynamics in that the drivers with missing higher quarter times and higher mean times per session indicate weaker performance in comparison to their teammate.\nThis racecraft analysis highlights how effectively each driver converts their qualifying position into race results, revealing substantial differences within several teams. Norris, Sainz, and Hamilton consistently gain positions on race day, marking them as standouts in overtaking, tire management, or race strategy execution. Their teammates, Piastri, Leclerc, and Russell, show slightly more variable outcomes, typically gaining fewer positions. One of the more interesting performances is Red Bull: Verstappen rarely gains or loses positions because he starts at the front, while Perez may slip backward from strong qualifying spots, emphasizing a persistent race-day deficit. Overall, the plot shows that while qualifying pace sets the stage, racecraft varies meaningfully within teams and strongly influences final outcomes.\nCode\n# Graph 4 — Wet vs. Dry Conditions Pace Comparison\nwet_pace &lt;- race_qual |&gt;\nfilter(!is.na(is_wet_qual)) |&gt;\ngroup_by(constructor, is_wet_qual) |&gt;\nsummarize(mean_qual = mean(qual_for_comparison, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nif (nrow(wet_pace) &gt; 0) {\nggplot(wet_pace, aes(x = as.factor(is_wet_qual), y = mean_qual, group = constructor, color = constructor)) +\ngeom_line(aes(group = constructor), linewidth = 1) +\ngeom_point(size = 2) +\nscale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"dry\",\"wet\")) +\nlabs(title = \"Team Pace: Wet vs Dry (mean qualifying position)\",\nx = \"Condition\", y = \"Mean Qualifying Position (lower = faster)\") +\nconstructor_palette\n} else {\nggplot() + labs(title = \"No wet/dry labels found in tracks_df — fill tracks_df$is_wet to enable this plot\")\n}",

    "text": "3.2 We are analyzing race pace in wet weather qualifying conditions compared to dry. Wet weather dramatically reduces grip and visibility, some consider it to even equalize differences in car performance.\nThis comparison of average qualifying performance in wet versus dry sessions reveals that most teams experience only modest changes in pace when conditions worsen, but a few show dramatic shifts. McLaren and Ferrari stand out as the strongest wet-weather qualifiers, improving relative to the field when the track becomes slippery—suggesting their cars maintain tire temperature and mechanical grip well. Aston Martin also gains performance in the wet, climbing several grid spots on average. On the other hand, traditionally strong teams like Mercedes and Red Bull qualify noticeably worse in the wet, indicating that their setups or driver comfort are more sensitive to unstable grip levels. Lower-grid teams such as Sauber and Williams remain near the back in both conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Graph 5 - Wet Qualifying Pace\n\nwet_qual_rounds &lt;- tracks_df |&gt; \n  filter(is_wet_qual == TRUE) |&gt;\n  pull(round)\n\nwet_qual_data &lt;- race_qual |&gt;\n  filter(round %in% wet_qual_rounds)\n\nggplot(\n  wet_qual_data |&gt; filter(!is.na(qual_for_comparison)),\n  aes(y = fct_reorder(driver, qual_for_comparison, .fun = median),\n    x = qual_for_comparison)) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.15, outlier.size = 1, alpha = 0.85) +\n  scale_x_reverse(breaks = c(20, 15, 10, 5, 1)) +\n  \n  facet_wrap(~ constructor, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Intra-Team Wet-Weather Qualifying Pace\",\n    x = \"Qualifying Position (lower = faster)\",\n    y = \"Driver\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"gray95\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, margin = margin(b = 8)),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\")",

    "text": "3.3 Subheading: Who Thrives When the Track Turns Wet? Intra-Team Pace Under Rain Conditions\nWet qualifying compresses the field and is said to expose pure driver skill. Across teams, the drivers positioned farther to the right are those who deliver stronger wet-weather performance. McLaren sees Norris consistently outperform Piastri in the rain, while Hamilton shows a noticeable wet-pace advantage over Russell at Mercedes. Ferrari’s intra-team battle tightens, with Sainz marginally outperforming Leclerc when grip is at a premium. Red Bull’s wet performance split is especially stark in that Verstappen reliably anchors the right side of the distribution while Pérez drifts left, indicating greater difficulty in low-grip conditions. Teams lower in the order—such as Williams and Alpine display tighter teammate groupings, suggesting car limitations overshadow driver differences.\n\n\nCode\n# Graph 6 — Wet vs. Dry Conditions Racecraft Comparison\nlibrary(Polychrome)\n\n\nWarning: package 'Polychrome' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nCode\ndriver_palette &lt;- createPalette(length(unique(race_qual$driver)), seedcolors=c(\"#ff0000\"))\nnames(driver_palette) &lt;- sort(unique(race_qual$driver))\n\n\nwetdry_driver &lt;- race_qual |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(is_wet_race)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    condition = ifelse(is_wet_race, \"Wet\", \"Dry\"),\n    condition = factor(condition, levels = c(\"Dry\", \"Wet\"))\n  )\n\n# Summarize per driver per condition\nwetdry_driver_summary &lt;- wetdry_driver |&gt;\n  group_by(constructor, driver, condition) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    mean_gain = mean(positions_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nggplot(\n  wetdry_driver_summary,\n  aes(\n    x = condition,\n    y = mean_gain,\n    group = driver,\n    color = driver\n  )\n) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.8, linewidth = 0.9) +\n\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Dry\", \"Wet\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = driver_palette) +   # &lt;-- NEW PALETTE\n\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~ constructor,\n    scales = \"free_y\",\n    labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 12)) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Wet vs Dry Racecraft: Intra-Team Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Each line represents one driver within a team, showing how their average positions gained changes in wet vs dry races.\",\n    x = \"Conditions\",\n    y = \"Mean Positions Gained\",\n    color = \"Driver\"\n  ) +\n\n  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"gray95\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.key.size = unit(0.45, \"lines\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 7),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.spacing.y = unit(0.1, \"cm\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 1))",

For example, both Alpine, Sauber, and Haas see strong positive gains in the wet, with certain drivers making significantly more progress than they manage in dry races. These trends suggest confident car control and adaptability under low-grip conditions. By contrast, Aston Martin, RB, and Williams show the opposite behavior, where drivers tend to perform worse in wet races, losing more positions on average compared to their dry-race results. Mercedes, Red Bull, and McLaren reveal clear divergence between teammates in that one driver improves dramatically in the wet while the other falls off, indicating that wet-weather performance is more driver-dependent rather than car-dependent in these teams.\n\n\nCode\n# Graph 7 — Circuit Type Pace Comparison\n\nstreet_stats &lt;- race_qual |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(circuit_type)) |&gt;\n  group_by(constructor, driver, circuit_type) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    mean_qual = mean(qual_for_comparison, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(n &gt;= 2) |&gt;   # require at least 2 appearances per type\n  mutate(circuit_type = factor(circuit_type, levels = c(\"permanent\", \"street\")))\n\nggplot(\n  street_stats,\n  aes(\n    x = circuit_type,\n    y = mean_qual,\n    group = driver,\n    color = driver\n  )) +\n  \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n\n  scale_y_reverse() +   # lower positions = better\n  scale_color_manual(values = driver_palette) + \n  facet_wrap(\n    ~ constructor,\n    scales = \"free_y\",\n    labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 12)) +\n  labs(title = \"Intra-Team Qualifying Pace: Street vs Permanent Circuits\",\n    x = \"Circuit Type\",\n    y = \"Mean Qualifying Position\",\n    color = \"Driver\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"gray95\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 15, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 7),\n    legend.key.size = unit(0.35, \"cm\"),\n    legend.spacing.y = unit(0.15, \"cm\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 1))",

    "text": "3.5 How Drivers Adapt Their Pace Across Street vs Permanent Circuits - Street Circuits Can Require Greater Confidence and Precision\nAcross teams, most drivers demonstrate noticeably different qualifying performance depending on circuit type, reinforcing that pace is strongly track-dependent. Mercedes, Alpine, and Williams show consistent improvements on street circuits, where lower-speed technical sections reward mechanical grip and confidence on the limit. Conversely, McLaren, Haas, Red Bull, and Sauber tend to perform similarly or even slightly worse on street tracks, suggesting their strengths lean toward high-speed or more traditional layouts.

    "text": "3.8 Comparing predicted intra-team rankings to actual finishing order from the 2024 season\nThis plot compares each driver’s predicted intra-team ranking—based on qualifying pace, racecraft, wet-weather adjustments, street/permanent circuit effects, and low-overtake performance with their actual 2024 finishing order within their team.\nOverall, the model performs surprisingly well given its simplicity. It almost completely ranks each drivers’ intra-team standing accurately compared to the actual 2024 drivers’ champioship standings. Some of the teams have a 3rd driver considered due to mid-season switches, which skews the analysis. However, of the team with 2 drivers, it seems that only Sauber was ranked incorrectly. Moreover, the Sauber mismatches likely stem from Bottas’s unusually unlucky season relative to Zhou, despite underlying pace indicators suggesting the reverse. Some discrepancies arise in situations where 2024 real-world results were shaped by externalities not captured in the model, like Magnussen’s unusual crash-heavy season distort the underlying pace-based expectation.\nDespite these exceptions, the model’s broad accuracy indicates that racecraft, qualifying pace, and condition-dependent performance explain a substantial portion of intra-team outcomes. This makes it a strong foundation for interpretable ML and a great candidate for further analysis via Shapley values.\n\n\nCode\n# Graph 11 - Posthoc ML Analysis with Shapley Values!\nlibrary(iml)\n\n\nWarning: package 'iml' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nCode\n# predictor matrix used in modeling\nX &lt;- pair_model |&gt;\n  select(\n    diff_avg_qual_pos,\n    diff_avg_positions_gained,\n    diff_wet_gain_delta,\n    diff_street_gain_delta,\n    diff_lowOver_gain_delta\n  )\n\ny &lt;- pair_model$A_beats_B\n\npredict_fun &lt;- function(model, newdata) {\n  predict(model, newdata = as.data.frame(newdata), type = \"response\")\n}\n\nX_clean &lt;- X\nattr(X_clean, \"assign\") &lt;- NULL\nattr(X_clean, \"contrasts\") &lt;- NULL\n\nlibrary(iml)\n\npredictor_obj &lt;- Predictor$new(\n  model = model_racecraft,\n  data  = as.data.frame(X_clean),\n  y     = y,\n  predict.function = predict_fun\n)\n\nshap &lt;- Shapley$new(predictor_obj, x.interest = X_clean[1,])\n\nlogloss &lt;- function(actual, predicted) {\n  # numerical stabilizer for log()\n  eps &lt;- 1e-15\n  predicted &lt;- pmin(pmax(predicted, eps), 1 - eps)\n\n  -mean(actual * log(predicted) + (1 - actual) * log(1 - predicted))\n}\n\nimp &lt;- FeatureImp$new(\n  predictor_obj,\n  loss = logloss\n)\n\n\nWarning: package 'future' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'listenv' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'scatterplot3d' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'parallelly' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'Metrics' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'checkmate' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'globals' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'visdat' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nCode\nplot(imp)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the iml package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/giuseppec/iml/issues&gt;.",

    "text": "3.9 Feature Importance: Which Factors Most Influence Intra-Team Outcomes?\nThe Shapley-based feature importance analysis shows that average qualifying advantage overwhelmingly drives the model’s ability to predict which teammate finishes ahead. Racecraft plays a secondary role, offering modest predictive value, while situational effects—wet-weather performance, street-track advantage, and performance on low-overtaking circuits—contribute very little overall. This suggests that across a full season, consistent single-lap pace may be the clearest and most reliable differentiator between teammates, with racecraft providing additional but smaller impact.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project set out to evaluate what truly drives Formula 1 driver performance once external factors such as car strength, circuit characteristics, and weather variability are controlled for, and the analyses across qualifying pace, racecraft, wet-weather adaptability, circuit type differences, and overtaking difficulty reveal a fairly consistent story that driver performance within a team is overwhelmingly defined by qualifying pace, with racecraft providing the next strongest source of differentiation. Condition-specific factors, like wet races, street circuits, and overtaking difficulty, proved far less influential in determining intra-team outcomes, a finding reinforced by the interpretable logistic model and Shapley value analysis. The model’s strong alignment with actual 2024 intra-team standings shows that a small number of intuitive, interpretable features explain much of the competitive hierarchy among teammates. At the same time, the mismatches highlight critical limitations of purely performance-based modeling, like luck-driven events such as engine failures, long pit stops, safety-car timing, DNFs, and team strategy calls can meaningfully distort race outcomes in ways not captured by average pace or racecraft metrics. Future extensions could explore further explicitly modeling these randomness components, quantifying reliability effects, pit stop variance, or luckier strategy. Overall, this project demonstrates how contextualized data analysis and interpretable machine learning together can uncover the defining factors of driver performance, separating true skill from the noise introduced by machinery and environment.",
